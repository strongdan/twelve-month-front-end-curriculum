# Twelve Month Plan to Learn Front-end Web Development

This is my personalized weekly schedule to gain expertise with front-end JavaScript and some front-end frameworks like Angular, React and Bootstrap. This schedule relies heavily on the Udacity [Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree Program], but includes additional coursework to improve basic JavaScript knowledge. Each week there is a web development course, a JavaScript course, a book for reading and coding practice using Free Code Camp, Exercism or Code Wars.
