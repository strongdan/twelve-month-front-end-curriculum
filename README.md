# One Year Plan to Learn Front-End Web Development

This is my personalized 52-week schedule to gain expertise with front-end JavaScript and front-end frameworks like Angular, React and Bootstrap. The first half of this schedule is centered around the Udacity [Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/mobile-web-specialist-nanodegree--nd024), but includes additional coursework to improve basic JavaScript knowledge. The second half of the program includes a lot of projects, front-end frameworks, the development process, computer science concepts, technical interview preparation and practice working with web APIs. Each week there is a course covering web development, one covering JavaScript, a book to review key concepts and coding practice using Free Code Camp, Exercism or Code Wars.
